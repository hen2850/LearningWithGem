About meHi, I am Gemma Van Laeren and I have been teaching for over 25 years in both special education and mainstream settings.My passion has always been in Literacy and supporting students struggling to be successful in this area to become confident and competent with reading and writing.Ê My continuing search to upskill and looking for answers to provide this support led me to the MSL approach.Ê I began private practice in this area after seeing the results of structured literacy and how effective it is and what a difference it can make in empowering students.
