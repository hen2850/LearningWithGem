Sessions are One to one and teacher led, providing explicit, systematic, and sequential phonics-based instruction.  * Students experience a high degree of success in each session.* First session or two involves assessment to determine gaps in knowledge.* Skills are taught thoroughly and at a pace that works for individual students.* Work in the sessions is supplementary to work in the classroom, providing intervention for reading and writing.  It will not necessarily correlate with what is being taught in the classroom.  Instead, it is working with the student systematically at their point of need to fill in any gaps in knowledge.
