Welcome to learning with Gem
Develop reading, writing and spelling skills using the Multisensory Structured Language (MSL) approach.
Systematic, synthetic approach – working on developing strong foundational skills and building on these when the student is ready.  Aimed at developing automaticity and accuracy by providing enough practice to consolidate learning.
Pace that suits the individual student.
A supportive and engaging environment where students experience success and build confidence in themselves and their ability to crack the code of our language and be confident with reading and writing.
